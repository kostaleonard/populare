# Populare

*Code as social media.*

Populare is a SaaS social media app in which all posts are code. Users can post
in any language they want, as long as it's one of the following:

* Python
* [&#9819; (the language formerly known as Komodo)](#komodo)

Posts failing to conform to language syntax will be rejected.

## Quickstart

### &#9819; (the language formerly known as Komodo)<a id='komodo'></a>

&#9819; (the language formerly known as Komodo) is a domain-specific language
used for expressing emotion in a syntactically and logically rigorous manner. An
excerpt from the context-free grammar is shown below.

```
Post -> [Template]
Post -> [Template] [Conjunction] [Template]

Template -> [Object]
Template -> [Object]!
Template -> [Object]?
Template -> [Object]...
Template -> [Object] ahead
Template -> No [Object] ahead
Template -> [Object] required ahead
Template -> Be wary of [Object]
Template -> If only I had a [Object]
Template -> Visions of [Object]
Template -> Time for [Object]
Template -> Huh, it's a [Object]...
Template -> Praise the [Object]!
Template -> Let there be [Object]
Template -> Ah, [Object]...

Conjunction -> and then
Conjunction -> therefore
Conjunction -> in short
Conjunction -> or
Conjunction -> only
Conjunction -> by the way
Conjunction -> so to speak
Conjunction -> all the more
Conjunction -> ,

Object -> docstring
Object -> indent
Object -> logic error
Object -> unit tests
Object -> continuation line
Object -> machine learning
Object -> variable name
Object -> object oriented programming
Object -> style guide
Object -> DevOps
Object -> Agile coach
Object -> computer science
Object -> programmer
Object -> semaphore
Object -> Dining Philosophers
Object -> Dijkstra's Algorithm
Object -> Halting Problem
Object -> NP-hard
```

&#9819; (the language formerly known as Komodo) was designed to be maximally
expressive; we have found that no additional terminal or non-terminal symbols
were necessary to cover the range of human emotion.
